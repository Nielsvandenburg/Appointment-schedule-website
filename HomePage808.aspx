                        Meet the Maker; MetroGnome
                       </h4>
                        Swazi born beat maker Mhleli Nkambule; aka MetroGnome derived his stage name from the
                        tempo tapper/ metronome in his uncle’s Medelli synthesizer. He has been interested in Hip Hop
                        music from a young age. Growing up his taste in music was influenced by his older brother and he
                        cites the likes of Skwatta Kamp, Dr Dre, Oskido, Sipho Hotstix Mabuse, Eminem and Lil Wayne as
                        his early influences in music. At the age of 16, MetroGnome met his estranged uncle who had
                        recently retired from a career as a University Professor. He let him play with his Medelli 
                        synthesiser and make melodies. At the time MetroGnome had no prior knowledge about music theory,
                        and so his uncle taught him the basics and introduced him to music theory. He also learnt
                        to play drums on an MPK sampler and the piano. Later MetroGnome took to beat making as an alternative
                        to making compositions. After an unlikely meeting with Salute Nation rapper R.K in 2015, he became lightly
                        involved with the music collective and now manages a few of their promotional endeavours.
                        MetroGnome is currently studying at the University of Oklahoma in the United States.
